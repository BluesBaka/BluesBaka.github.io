An Ode to Atomized Code:

My heart leaps up when I behold
The a codebase- clean and dry:
To transform inputs, returns, and filenames
To transform hashes, arrays, and strings,
To transform into logic bold
    Objects! reusable and seperate- oftentimes with binding.pry,
		
The smelly- reclaimed into descrete things.
I how I study hard to earn
the best practices to support my learn.



The principles of OOD are creating the next transfomative epoch in labor and industry- automation by atomization.  I'm so pleased to be getting the hang of reusable code.
