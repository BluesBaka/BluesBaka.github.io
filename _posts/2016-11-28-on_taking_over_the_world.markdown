The question of "why learn to code?" is a simple begining to a complex answer.  I joined Flatiron with the intention of getting a slice of the new world order. Old ways of producing and deseminating content are fading more and more quickly- almost as soon as one gets a handle on a technique the contemporary conversation of business and inovation has moved on. 

  When faced with the need to make a new life for myself- post American-white-picket-fence dreams- I looked at a few of my options.  I could go back into healthcare- a field that I am familar with and know the rythyms of- working with super smart doctors and surgeons again and doing my best to do right by people in a bad way.  I could take my savings and goodwill and learn a trade- massage therapy, long haul trucking, home inspection. All necessary jobs and worthwhile trades. I could settle into making a go of resturant work and showing love through food. I was lucky enough to have the support of my friends and loved ones to have the time to consider all of these as options, eventually discarding each as I investigated the longer term prospects. 
	
	My whole life I've been subtly avoiding the tech sector- both of my older and wiser brothers got in early, but I felt like the world of writing code and solving problems with robots was far out of reach of my artistically inclined mind. I'm a musician and dancer by preferance- neither of which came easily for me- and had always considered myself too right brained to make an effective planner or code monkey.  
	
	All this despite the fact that my closest friends have always been envolved in software or hardware dev, and that my favorite pass time is figuring out the most generalized and abstract versions of categories (anybody want to discuss the idea of gem stones and batteries and magnets all as different forms of "rocks"? I could go for hours.) I like problem solving in as many contexts as possible.  
	
	The financial reality of living in Seattle is that no one can afford to live here without a job that pays over 70k.  Over the six months of contemplation between my finding myself at a crossroads and joining the ranks of Flatiron all of these factors were in mind.  Adding my input into the cognitive sphere of creating solutions for a multitude of human problems.  It's a start into a whole new way of living.
